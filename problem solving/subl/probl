1-you have infinity of coins with values 2**i for all i positive integers
and you are going to buy some items , what is the mimum NUMBER of coins you are going to spend(2 pieces)
2-sum of pairs and impairs with bit and update 
3- how many numbers p <= m such that exsts q  and r such q*m = 1 + p*r
4-  graph with path divisible by x (mimimum x and length of the path );
prime query -update with bit
test all 1 in prefix query
