for the solution of this porblem , actually used the forume in this link https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/218890/how-many-numbers-in-a-given-range-are-coprime-to-n (third response) we can see that we can calculate f(C) which is the number of integers from 1 to C that are relatively prime to N . But we can't use it as it is because we can calculate f(D)-f(C-1) for every N between A and B but this gives us TLE . So we need to analyze the formula more. If we iterate over d ( in the forumla which is a divisor of N ) we can see that in the final sum we will have u(d) * ((D/d)-((C-1)/d))  * (number of multiples of d between A and B)
so in this case we iterate d from 1 to b , let x be the number of multiples of d between A and B  then we add to the answer the last formula i gave .
u(d) is the mobius function you can find it's definition in the internet .
